Simple Density Front-End
===================

To use, first, clone the repo and launch app.py. Then, navigate to localhost:5000/information/[query]?auth=[auth_token]. If [query] is an integer, you will receive the n least crowded buildings on campus. If [query] is a string, you will receive information about how crowded that building is. [<auth_token] is your Density auth token, which can be obtained at https://density.adicu.com/docs with a valid UNI.
